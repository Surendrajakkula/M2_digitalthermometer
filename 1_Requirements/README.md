INTRODUCTION
Digital thermometers are temperature-sensing instruments that are easily portable, have permanent probes, and a convenient digital display. The way a digital thermometer works depends upon its type of sensor. Sensor types include resistance temperature detector (RTD), thermocouple and thermistor.
RESEARCH
The source code is to be compiled in VS CODE with AVR compiler. This Digital thermometer is coded in EMBEDDED C is not designed to run on the Turbo C versions.
