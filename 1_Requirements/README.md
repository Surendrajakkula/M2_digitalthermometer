INTRODUCTION


Digital thermometers are temperature-sensing instruments that are easily portable, have permanent probes, and a convenient digital display. The way a digital thermometer works depends upon its type of sensor. Sensor types include resistance temperature detector (RTD), thermocouple and thermistor.



RESEARCH


The source code is to be compiled in VS CODE with AVR compiler. This Digital thermometer is coded in EMBEDDED C is not designed to run on the Turbo C versions.

ADVANTAGES

The advantages of digital thermometers are that they are inexpensive, easy to read, require very little maintenance and give an accurate reading. 


DISADVANTAGES

The disadvantage is that they get damaged easily if dropped and the battery powering them eventually runs out.
